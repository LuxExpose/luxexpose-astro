# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always Commit Your Work

## Why This File Exists

We lost a full day of work because changes were never committed to git. This file serves as a reminder to **always commit your work**.

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Frequently
- Commit after completing each feature or component
- Don't wait until the end of the day
- Small, frequent commits are better than one large commit

### 2. Before Closing Your Editor
- **ALWAYS** check `git status` before closing
- If you see untracked or modified files, commit them
- Use `git add -A && git commit -m "Your message"`

### 3. Before Pulling/Merging
- Commit or stash your work before pulling from remote
- Never pull with uncommitted changes

### 4. Quick Commit Commands
```bash
# Check what's changed
git status

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Description of what you did"

# Push to remote (if you have a remote)
git push
```

## What Happened Yesterday

- Created 10+ new components
- Created utility functions
- Created city pages
- Created category and neighborhood pages
- Updated header and footer
- Added ocean sunset gradient
- **NONE of this was committed to git**
- All work was lost when something reset the working directory

## Prevention

1. **Set up a pre-commit hook** (optional but recommended)
2. **Use git stash** if you need to switch branches temporarily
3. **Commit at the end of each work session**
4. **Push to remote** regularly if you have one

## Current Status

All work has been restored and committed. The commit message includes a full list of what was restored.
